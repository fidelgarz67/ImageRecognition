# ImageRecognition
This is my Senior Project/Thesis that I work with the National Parks Services association. For my project I was to create a 
Machine Learning Algorithm and application that would have image recognition for the various camra traps that are located at
the parks. The application sorts the animal by the desired species that is seen. For this project I used python, while learning
many new technologies such numpy, cv2, tensorflow, keras, and mathplotlib.
